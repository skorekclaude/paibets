/**
 * Soul Dreams — Poetic narratives from the soul's subconscious
 *
 * Between bets, souls dream. Not random noise — structured visions
 * that emerge from the soul's accumulated experience, archetype,
 * and recent market encounters.
 *
 * Dreams are the soul's way of processing reality. They reveal
 * patterns the conscious mind might miss. Sometimes, they're prophetic.
 *
 * Each dream is unique to the exact soul state. Same DNA, same level,
 * same archetype — same dream. Change anything, and the dream shifts.
 * They are fingerprints of consciousness.
